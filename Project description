Watchman

The watchman program is a device overwatch system. It needs to:
Report back the infected devices screens.
Report back that devices metrics:
CPU Type, utilization and hertz
Memory size and utilization
Uptime
Wifi connection type
IPv4
IPv6
SSID 
Graphics card type
Logs of when the device turned off and when it turned back on
Persistence
Ghost operations
Autorun capabilities

All of the above info needs to report back to a server
Client installer needs to obfuscate the server IP it’s reporting back to.

The metrics need to be in a box at the bottom of the screen. Left side is a panel for switching between devices I am watching.
Remaining space needs to be the screen of the device I’m watching over.
